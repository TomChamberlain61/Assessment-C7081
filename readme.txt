Objective 
  The objective of this study was to apply a range of statsical learning techniques as described by James et al (2021) to a publicly available 
  subset of the data used by Aldrin and Haff (2005). Performance will be formally assessed using RMSE and classification error estimations as well as 
  for transparency, parsimony and simplicity.  
  
Conclusion

A wide range of modern statistical data learning techniques have been applied to a sample of data from an original study on particulate matter 
pollution (Aldrin and Haff, 2005). For a range of reasons the predictive capacity of these models is such that they will be of very limited 
applied use. The full data set were collected over sequential days and hours so incorporating and element of time series analysis (such as 
the logPM10 count at same time of previous day) may well improve the predictive ability.
